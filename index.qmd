# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is pretty much the default skeleton you get when you start a new Quarto book project.
Two things to do right away if you know you want to publish to GitHub Pages (all of this outlined [in the Quarto docs here](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html))

-    in `_quarto.yml` change `output-dir` to `docs` The `_quarto.yml` file is where lots of important things can be configured for your book, so you will likely add to it. See options (lots) at [this link to the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html)
-   Add a `.nojekyll` file to root of the repo (see more info in Quarto docs for the OS-specific way to do this)
-   Added a `.gitignore` file so that right away I'm not version controlling any of the user-specific or session-specific files related to RStudio. You will most certainly be expanding this `.gitignore` as you build out your book project. For example, to ignore reference files or notes that you don't want to share, or ignore large datasets / PDFs / things that aren't really amenable to version control with GitHub.

`.gitignore` because I am trying to show all the files associated with this skeleton book.
But you would almost certainly want to add one to ignore any auxiliary/references files or big datasets that might be living in the same directory as your book, but don't / shouldn't be version controlled.
