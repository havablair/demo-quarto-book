# Preface {.unnumbered}

This is pretty much the default skeleton you get when you start a new Quarto book project.
One thing I changed right away was in `_quarto.yml` change `output-dir` to `docs` (for publishing via GitHub pages).
The `_quarto.yml` file is where lots of important things can be configured for your book, so you will likely add to it.
See options (lots) at [this link to the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/projects/books.html)

NOTE: this repo does not contain a `.gitignore` because I am trying to show all the files associated with this skeleton book.
But you would almost certainly want to add one to ignore any auxiliary/references files or big datasets that might be living in the same directory as your book, but don't / shouldn't be version controlled.

## Some boilerplate stuff

This is a Quarto book.
